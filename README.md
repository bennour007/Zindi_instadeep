AI hack competition on the financial inclusion in africa
I have tried the random forest algorithm with this data set, the Only issue though I did not pay attension to was the tremendous inequality between the levels of the target variable which i called Y, (bank account).
the preprocessing was clean and fun, however, due to my machine limitation i had no time to tune the model to my satisfaction and standards.
I can say that this is a cute little rushed work, which i hreally wished to submit to the competiton, unfortuenatly I couln't do that on time.
I hope this get the necessary attention, I am looking for feedback on how to improve my code, and will commit other versions in the future.
the link to thie competitioon website and the data info and all of that :
